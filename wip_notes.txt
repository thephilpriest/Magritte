1. it is not possible for a smidgeon to see that things in front of it have any intentions, it is only possible to see their state (velocity and ins_acc)

2. The smidgeons are not aware of their location. 

3. The pipe knows the location of each smidgeon

4. There are 2 passes for each time slice
	1. Determine the action for each smidgeon
	2. Take the action for each smidgeon

5. What units will we be using here?
	standard
	metric
	other

6. Should we assert tailgating in terms of time or distance/velocity

7. each cycle needs to be a function of how much time the user says each cycle covers and the speed limit
